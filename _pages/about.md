Hello! I am a fourth-year undergraduate student at the University of Toronto, studying computer science and cognitive science.

My research at the <a href='https://www.cs.toronto.edu/compling/'>CL Group</a> (computational linguistics group), supervised by <a href='http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~gpenn/'>Professor Gerald Penn</a>, is focussed on developing novel machine learning techniques to predict speech signal-to-noise ratios (SNR) using ASR error as a proxy signal.

At the <a href='https://www.utsc.utoronto.ca/people/niemeier/'>CoNSens Lab</a> (cognitive neuroscience & sensorimotor integration lab), I am researching deep reinforcement learning models of feature integration in the brain for sensorimotor grasping tasks, under the supervision of <a href='https://www.psych.utoronto.ca/people/directories/all-faculty/matthias-niemeier'>Professor Matthias Niemeier</a>. 

I am currently interested in researching shared semantic representations between language and vision, and how they relate human and machine cognition. In my spare time, I like to go on long walks, preferably by the sea. Sometimes I like to make art too.

<b>Research Interests:</b> <i>Computational Linguistics, Natural Language Processing, Deep Reinforcement Learning, Computational Neuroscience, Computer Vision, Automatic Speech Recognition, Semantic Representations</i>
