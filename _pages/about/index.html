I am a fourth-year undergraduate student at the University of Toronto, studying computer science and cognitive science.</p> <p>At the <a href="https://www.cs.toronto.edu/compling/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Computational Linguistics Group</a>, I am investigating novel machine learning techniques to predict speech signal-to-noise ratios (SNR) using ASR error, under the supervision of <a href="http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~gpenn/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Professor Gerald Penn</a>. At the Cognitive Neuroscience &amp; Sensorimotor Integration Lab (<a href="https://www.utsc.utoronto.ca/people/niemeier/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">CoNSens</a>), I am researching deep reinforcement learning models of feature integration in the brain for sensorimotor grasping tasks, under the supervision of <a href="https://www.psych.utoronto.ca/people/directories/all-faculty/matthias-niemeier" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Professor Matthias Niemeier</a>. I am currently interested in researching shared semantic representations between language and vision, and how they relate human and machine cognition.</p> <p>In my spare time, I like to go on long walks, preferably by the sea. Sometimes I like to make art too.</p> <p><b>Research Interests:</b> Computational Linguistics, Natural Language Processing, Deep Reinforcement Learning, Computational Neuroscience, Computer Vision, Automatic Speech Recognition, Semantic Representations</p> </body></html>
