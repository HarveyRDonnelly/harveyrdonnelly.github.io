I am a fourth-year undergraduate student at the University of Toronto, studying computer science and cognitive science.</p> <p>My research at the <a href="https://www.cs.toronto.edu/compling/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">CL Group</a> (computational linguistics group), supervised by <a href="http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~gpenn/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Professor Gerald Penn</a>, is focussed on developing novel machine learning techniques to predict speech signal-to-noise ratios (SNR) using ASR error as a proxy signal.</p> <p>At the <a href="https://www.utsc.utoronto.ca/people/niemeier/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">CoNSens Lab</a> (cognitive neuroscience &amp; sensorimotor integration lab), I am researching deep reinforcement learning models of feature integration in the brain for sensorimotor grasping tasks, under the supervision of <a href="https://www.psych.utoronto.ca/people/directories/all-faculty/matthias-niemeier" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Professor Matthias Niemeier</a>.</p> <p>I am currently interested in researching shared semantic representations between language and vision, and how they relate human and machine cognition. In my spare time, I like to go on long walks, preferably by the sea. Sometimes I like to make art too.</p> <p><b>Research Interests:</b> <i>Computational Linguistics, Natural Language Processing, Deep Reinforcement Learning, Computational Neuroscience, Computer Vision, Automatic Speech Recognition, Semantic Representations</i></p> </body></html>
